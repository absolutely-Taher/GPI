## 📋 Configuration Details

### Chosen Category for Specific Category Screen
**Category: Beauty** 💄  

The "Specific Category" screen (second tab) displays products filtered from the **beauty** category via the DummyJSON API endpoint `/products/category/beauty`.

**Why Beauty?**
- Rich product variety (makeup, skincare, fragrances)
- Good visual appeal with diverse product images
- Represents a popular e-commerce category
- Contains sufficient products for testing

### Superadmin Configuration
**Username:** `emilys`  
**Designation:** Superadmin role with delete permissions

This user is hardcoded in the authentication logic to have elevated permissions for product management on the All Products screen.

### Cache Strategy
- **React Query** with MMKV persistence
- **Garbage Collection:** 24-hour retention
- **Stale Time:** 5 minutes
- **Features:**
  - Cache survives app restarts
  - Instant data display on relaunch (online or offline)
  - Automatic background refetch when stale
  - Optimistic updates for better UX

## ⚖️ Trade-offs & Future Improvements

### What I Built ✅
